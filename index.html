  <p>Darkspeed is a website that acts as a portal to many games and related tools, such as unblockers. We have 5 games and counting.</p>
  <p>Note to schools: Please, if a student is causing problems with this, talk to them, or block just this one student. This is meant to be used to have fun at school, but we do not want to compromise education in doing so. Please don't be lazy, don't take a passive stance on this, and make school fun again. Don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch. If you are experiencing major issues with this site, such as students accessing explicit sites, please block it for all students immediately, while we work on a fix. Contact 'darkspeed@tutanota.com' for support, we should be able to help you.</p>
